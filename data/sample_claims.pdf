# This is a placeholder for sample claim documents
# In a real implementation, this would be a PDF file containing sample insurance claim forms
# with various types of claims (medical, auto, property, etc.) for testing the OCR and classification system.

# Sample claim structure:
# - Patient/Insured Name
# - Date of Service/Incident
# - Diagnosis/Condition
# - Amount Claimed
# - Provider Information
# - Policy Number
# - Service Details

# The PDF would contain multiple pages with different claim types to test the system's ability
# to extract various field formats and classify different claim scenarios.
